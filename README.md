### Acknowledgments:
The University of Washington SASWE Research Group is grateful to People's Republic of Bangladesh Water Ministry and Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) for the close technical support provided. The data and guidance provided by BWDB engineers have helped conduct the research and develop the satellite-based citizen science haor volume estimation technique. This work is also supported by NASA-supported project titled “Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists & Satellites” led by University of North Carolina (Dr. Tamlin Pavelsky). Additional support from HMRC and Tennessee Technological University is gratefully acknowledged. SASWE Group takes pride in another computationally efficient and locally constrained system launch that is currently guiding the monitoring dry season surface water storage capacity for the entire country via the Delta Plan-2100.
